                 I started on the retail floor and stayed because I loved the work people do every day. 
                 Over 21 years I moved from frontline roles into leadership, carrying one conviction with me: 
                 when people are supported, trained, and trusted, they do extraordinary work. 
                 That belief guided my time at Sam’s Club and Rooms To Go and now shapes how I lead in Rooms to Go while 
                 running De La Rosa Realty. My career is measured not only in P&L and sales figures but in the leaders 
                 I helped grow and the teams that learned to solve problems together.
                 <br><br>
                 Mentoring Philosophy

People first. I lead by listening before prescribing. I believe mentorship is a two-way conversation 
where curiosity, patience, and honest feedback create space for growth.
Growth over perfection. I focus on progress—small wins, repeated—rather than one-off perfection. 
This reduces fear of failure and encourages experimentation.
Contextual coaching. Training must match the moment: quick, practical coaching on the floor; 
structured development plans for aspiring managers; and strategic mentorship for leaders 
preparing to run a facility.
<br><br><br>
 How I Develop Others
<br><br>
• One-on-one coaching with clear, actionable next steps and follow-up to track progress.<br>
• Shadowing and stretch assignments that let associates learn by doing while still having a safety net.<br>
• Structured training programs I designed as a Store Manager Trainer and Regional Mentor 
to standardize best practices while leaving room for individual strengths.<br>
• Regular feedback loops that combine data (KPIs, P&L, safety metrics) with human observations 
so coaching is both measurable and meaningful.<br>
• Recognition and celebration of milestones—promotions, safety improvements, customer service wins—to 
reinforce behaviors and build confidence.
<br><br><br><br>
 Concrete Examples
<br><br>
• Built leaders from within. I mentored associates into supervisory and management roles, 
creating a pipeline that improved retention and reduced hiring costs.<br>
• Safety culture through coaching. By coaching frontline leaders on near‑miss reporting 
and root‑cause thinking, we cut accident costs dramatically and made safety a shared responsibility.<br>
• Operational ownership. I coached teams to own P&L outcomes by teaching them how daily decisions 
affect margins, which led to sustained profitability improvements across multiple clubs.<br>
<br><br><br><br>
 Core Principles
<br><br>
• Empathy and Respect — Treat every person as a whole person, not just a role.<br>
• Psychological Safety — Create environments where people can speak up, make mistakes, and learn.<br>
• Clarity and Accountability — Set clear expectations and support people to meet them.<br>
• Continuous Learning — Use Lean Six Sigma and 5S as tools for everyday improvement, not just projects.<br>
• Servant Leadership — My job is to remove obstacles so others can succeed.
