                 I’m a people-first retail leader with 21+ years of experience who believes lasting results 
                 come from developing others, solving problems, and insisting on excellence. As Market Manager 
                 I led 11 stores with a $1B combined top line and earned Market of the Year by raising standards, 
                 consistency, and customer experience. I pair Lean Six Sigma rigor with hands-on mentorship—coaching 
                 store managers in the moment, turning frontline feedback into practical solutions, and building teams 
                 that own outcomes. My focus is simple: empower people, remove obstacles, and create repeatable processes 
                 so stores run safer, leaner, and more customer-centered every day.</h3></p>
