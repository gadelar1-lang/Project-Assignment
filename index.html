                <p> <h3><span class="hello">Hello! Thank you for stopping by.</span> <br><br>
                 I’m Gabriel De La Rosa, a retail operations leader who thrives on building strong teams 
                 and creating environments where people and businesses succeed together. 
                 <br><br>
                 Over the past 25 years, I’ve guided facilities generating up to $127M in annual sales, 
                 while keeping safety, customer experience, and community impact at the heart of my work. 
                 Whether it’s scaling omnichannel strategies, mentoring future leaders, or reducing 
                 accident costs by over 90%, I bring a people first approach backed by Lean Six Sigma expertise 
                 and a passion for operational excellence. Beyond the numbers, I’m proud of the culture
                 I’ve helped shape—raising funds for local causes, supporting community programs, and ensuring 
                 every team member feels valued and empowered.</h3></p>
